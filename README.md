Text-based streaming tool for streamers who code

## The idea

Currently streamers-who-code uses video-based streaming services (YouTube, Twitch...), which is not optimised for mostly text-based scenarious. My idea is to create a tool which will be used as an add-on to video, but specifically for transmitting text-based data right from the streamer's code editor to the viewer.

It will allow better text rendering quality, will provide ways to customize style of streaming text and add more ways to realtime interactions with the audience.

## SPOILER: right now I have now idea where to start!
but I'll try
